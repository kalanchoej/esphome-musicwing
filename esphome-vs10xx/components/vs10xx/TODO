SM_DIFF left channel inverted option

SM_PDOWN power down option

SCI_BASS for treble/bass control

SCI_DECODE_TIME, SCI_AUDATA sensors
SCI_HDAT0 and SCI_HDAT1 text sensor? (type of audio + sample & bit rate)

Hard reset device when it failed on a pre-defined or configured interval?
This could help with some auto-recovery. I haven't seen the practical need
for this in testing yet.
